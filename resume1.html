    <b>Railway anti-collision system using Arduino board and gps sensors</b>
● Railway anti-collision systems prevent train collisions using technologies like GPS, radar, and communication networks.
● These systems track train positions, speed, and direction in real-time to maintain safe distances between trains.
● Automated braking and signaling mechanisms are used to avoid potential collisions by taking preemptive actions.
● These systems enhance railway safety and operational efficiency by reducing the risk of accidents.
